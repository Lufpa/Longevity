GO enrichment analysis for the longevity-related SNPs
We use Gowinda (Kofler & Schl√∂tterer, 2012) which accounts for biases in SNP-to-gene mapping due to gene length. 

It currently runs in parallel for x number of files containing SNPs for which GO enrichment will be calculated
In this particular case, we analyzed 4 files:
1 = shared SNPs
2 = control only SNPs
3 = hs only SNPs
4 = all SNPs
