The code 
1) runs differentail gene expression analysis for young vs old flies using DESEQ2
2) plots basic plots of the RNAseq data and results
3) overlaps diff. expression data and allele freq. changes data
4) runs GO enrichment for the genes that overlap between DE and AFC using XGR
5) plots resuls of GO enrichment (GOenrichmentResults.pdf)



*Note: all code and results were updated with the new AFC results
